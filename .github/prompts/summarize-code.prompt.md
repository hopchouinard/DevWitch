# Summarize Code

Generate a comprehensive summary of the selected code file or module. Follow these guidelines:

## Summary Structure

Provide a clear overview that includes:

1. **Purpose** - What the code is designed to do
2. **Main Components** - Key classes, functions, or modules
3. **Input/Output** - What data goes in and what comes out
4. **Dependencies** - External libraries or modules used
5. **Side Effects** - File operations, network calls, state changes
6. **Key Algorithms** - Important logic or processing steps

## Analysis Depth

Include:

- **High-level functionality** - Overall purpose and workflow
- **Public interface** - Main entry points and APIs
- **Data flow** - How information moves through the code
- **Error handling** - How errors and exceptions are managed
- **Configuration** - Any settings or parameters that affect behavior

## Output Format

Structure the summary as:

1. **Overview** (2-3 sentences about the main purpose)
2. **Key Functions/Classes** (brief description of major components)
3. **Inputs** (expected parameters, file inputs, etc.)
4. **Outputs** (return values, file outputs, side effects)
5. **Dependencies** (external requirements)
6. **Notable Features** (special algorithms, patterns, or considerations)

Keep the summary concise but comprehensive enough for someone unfamiliar with the code to understand its role and functionality.
